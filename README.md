# DL-Image-Lab : Framework for developing Deep Learning models for image analysis tasks


**DL-Image-Lab** is a napari plugin designed to make deep learning models for image analysis.

The projectâ€™s goal is to provide a user-friendly interface that seamlessly integrates with Napari, allowing :  

- **Annotation** incorporating model assisted annotation on top napari's annotation framework
- **Training** deep learning models on imaging datasets through the GUI
- **Running inference** using pre-trained or custom-trained models
- **Fine-tuning / adapting** existing models to new imaging conditions or domains


### Supported Tasks & Architectures  

- **Semantic segmentation (2D & 3D)** using **U-Net (2D and 3D variants)**.  
- **Instance segmentation** with **Mask R-CNN**.  
- **Object detection** with **Faster R-CNN**
- **Transformer** networks incoming in next version !
